I have created my first blog website, building the entire backend from scratch using Express.js. This project allowed me to implement several new technologies, including Nodemailer for email functionality and Web Push Notifications for real-time updates. I also developed the complete frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to explore a variety of tools and techniques in full-stack development. The website's design inspiration is taken from Figma blog website design by Shakil Khan and Zelal Hossain.
